      # Upbound OpenID Connect (OIDC)
      
      Using Upbound OIDC to authenticate to AWS eliminates the need to store credentials in this control plane.
      
      You will need to:
      
      1. Create an **AWS Application** that will be used to authenticate `provider-AWS`.
      2. Establish trust between your **AWS Application** and **Upbound** using a **Federated Credential**.
      3. Grant the necessary permissions to your **Application Service Principal** by assigning it a **Role**.
      4. Provide **Client ID**, **Tenant ID**, and **Subscription ID** of your **AWS Application**.

      ## Create an Application

      1. Sign in to [AWS portal](https://portal.AWS.com/).
      2. Go to **AWS Active Directory**.
      3. Select **App registrations** in the left navigation.
      4. Click **+ New registration**.
      5. In the **Name** field enter `upbound-oidc-provider`.
      6. In the **Supported account types**> section select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
      7. In the **Redirect URI** section select **Web** and leave the **URL** field blank.
      8. Press **Register**.

      ## Create a Federated Credential

      When **Upbound** authenticates to **AWS** it provides an OIDC subject (`sub`) in the following format:
      ```
      mcp:<account>/<mcp-name>:provider:<provider-name>
      ```
