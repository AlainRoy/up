By default the default profile is overwritten. Use --profile to create or
update a different profile.

A Space profile communicates with a Space using a Kubernetes context from a
kubeconfig file. The kubeconfig and context may be selected using the
--kubeconfig and --kubecontext flags. If --kubeconfig is not provided, then the
profile will use the default kubeconfig at ~/.kube/config. If --kubecontext is
not provided, then the profile will use the kubeconfig's current default context
at the time this command was run. Changing the kubeconfig's default context
afterward will not change which context the profile uses.
